# ** Pizza Restaurant **

## Purpose

### The kids are hungry,
#### you're tired,
 they won't shut up,

<sup> please god</sup>

<sup><sub> make it end.</sub></sup>

## Instructions

- You can select as many toppings as you want, but be aware that certain toppings cost more than others.

- Of course, you can delete a pizza you don't want if it's too expensive! You can even leave everything off and just do cheese. Go ahead, be a bad parent. <sub> Your kids won't come to your funeral, but hey, what's a few bucks? </sub>

- Oh, and the wrong combination of toppings will wake the manager. You don't want to hear him perform. Believe me. It's so bad that everyone in the restaurant forgets what's being ordered. You'll have to start all over again.
