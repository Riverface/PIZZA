## Description
### The kids are hungry,
#### you're tired,
 they won't shut up,

<sup> please god</sup>

<sup><sub> make it end.</sub></sup>

You come across a Pizza place with the silhouette of a strange manager in t he window, portly and sleeping. Almost egg-shaped.

## Instructions

- You can select as many toppings as you want, but be aware that certain toppings cost more than others.
- Topping selection is very simple and there is even a little window that will tell you the controls.
- The controls, by the way, are:
- Click to select a topping. 
- Drag to select a topping or group of toppings.
- Ctrl+Click to select more than one topping or group of toppings.
- Of course, you can delete a pizza you don't want if it's too expensive! You can even leave everything off and just do cheese. Go ahead, be a bad parent. <sub> Your kids won't come to your funeral, but hey, what's a few bucks? </sub>

- Oh, and the wrong combination of toppings will wake the manager. You don't want to hear him perform. Believe me. It's so bad that everyone in the restaurant forgets what's being ordered. You'll have to start all over again.
