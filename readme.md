## How to use

- You can select as many toppings as you want, but be aware that certain toppings cost more than others.
- Topping selection is very simple and there is even a little window that will tell you the controls.
- The controls, by the way, are:
- Click to select a topping. 
- Drag to select a topping or group of toppings.
- Ctrl+Click to select more than one topping or group of toppings.
- Choosing odd toppings or implying things about the way he talks with your choices will wake up the portly, egg-shaped manager.
